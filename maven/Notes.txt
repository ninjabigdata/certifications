Maven
	Why Maven?
		Build tool for Java Applications
		70% of the build tool market
	
	Advantages
		Quick project setup
			Conventions over config --> reducing setup time
		Projects are modular
		Mature dependency mgmt
		Mature project build lifecycle
		Robust plugin community
	
	Terminologies
		Maven Coordiantes
			Together groupId, artifactId and version are called as maven coordiantes
			groupId and version can be imported from parent POM
			
			Maven version example:
				3.2.1-987-beta
				majorVersion.minorVersion.incrementalVersion-buildNumber-qualifier
			
			SNAPSHOT version --> specifies, it's a dev version
			
		Maven Repositories
			location where artifacts are stored
			Types
				Local
				Central
				Remote
		
		Maven Wagon
			A unified API
			A transport abstract for artifact and repo handling code
		
		Maven Project Object Model
		
		Dependency
			Dependency Scope
				compile, provided, runtime, test, system, import
			Dependency are managed by Maven Dependency Plugin
				Important Goals
					dependency:tree
					dependency:go-offline
					dependency:purge-local-repository
					dependency:sources
				
		Maven Standard Directory Layout
		
		Maven Build Lifecycles
			Lifecycle is a predefined group of build steps called phases
			Each phase can be bound to one or more plugin goals
		
			Lifecycles
				validate
				compile
				test
				package
				verify
				install
				deploy
		
		Maven Wrapper
	
	Common Maven Plugin
		Maven Clean Plugin
			Add the maven-clean-plugin to pom.xml under plugins
				<plugin>
					<artifactId>maven-clean-plugin</artifactsId>
					<version>3.1.0</version>
					<executions>
						<execution>
							<id>auto-clean</id>
							<phase>initialize</phase>
							<goals>
								<goal>clean</goal>
							</goals>
						</execution>
					</executions>
				</plugin>

	Maven Repository
		Order for resolving the artifact
			Local repository
			Maven Central
			Any additional repositories configured
			
		Repository Mirrors
			Are used to override project defined repository values
			Mirrors are confidured in settings.xml
			Mirror will override the URL of the repository
			Can be used to improve performance by directing to regional servers
			Or redirect to internal repository manager
			values set in settings.xml will apply to all projects executed on system
		
		Repository Element
			id
				unique value required
			name
				human readable name
			url
				URL for repository
			layout
				legacy or default (Default is generally used)
			releases
				Repository policy for handling downloading of releases
			snapshots
				Repository policy for handling downloading of snapshots
		
			
			Repository Policy
				used for release and snapshot elements of Repository elements
				
				enabled
					true or false
				updatePolicy
					always, daily (Default), interval:XXX(XXX in minutes), never
				checksumPolicy
					what to do if verification of artifact fail
					values: ignore, fail, warn
		
		Common Public Maven Repository
			Apache Maven
			Sonatype --> staging repository used to publish artifacts to Maven Central
			JCenter
				Default for Android Studio and Gradle
			JBoss
				Artifacts for JBoss
			Atlassian
			Oracle
			Spring Framework
			
		Maven Settings XML Elements
			localRepository
				Allows to override the location of local maven repository
			interactiveMode
				Allows to set interactive /batch mode. Defaults to interactive
			usePluginRegistry
				Maven 2.0. No longer used in Maven 3.0
			offline
				defaults to false. if true, maven does not connect to remote repositories
			pluginGroups
				list plugin group ids, to allow abbreviated plugin goals
			servers
				allows to set user credentials for servers which maven connects to
			mirrors
				allows to configure mirrors for repositories
			proxies
				define network proxies
			profiles
				define build profiles
			activeProfiles
				define active profile
			
		Maven Bill Of Materials
			Very similar to parent pom
			Inherits properties
			Set of curated dependencies
		
			BOM Configuration
				Set 
					common maven properties
					common maven plugins and configuration
					dependency version
					common dependencies
					common build profile
					any inhertiable property which is common
