Maven
	Why Maven?
		Build tool for Java Applications
		70% of the build tool market
	
	Advantages
		Quick project setup
			Conventions over config --> reducing setup time
		Projects are modular
		Mature dependency mgmt
		Mature project build lifecycle
		Robust plugin community
	
	Terminologies
		Maven Coordiantes
			Together groupId, artifactId and version are called as maven coordiantes
			groupId and version can be imported from parent POM
			
			Maven version example:
				3.2.1-987-beta
				majorVersion.minorVersion.incrementalVersion-buildNumber-qualifier
			
			SNAPSHOT version --> specifies, it's a dev version
			
		Maven Repositories
			location where artifacts are stored
			Types
				Local
				Central
				Remote
		
		Maven Wagon
			A unified API
			A transport abstract for artifact and repo handling code
		
		Maven Project Object Model
		
		Dependency
			Dependency Scope
				compile, provided, runtime, test, system, import
			Dependency are managed by Maven Dependency Plugin
				Important Goals
					dependency:tree
					dependency:go-offline
					dependency:purge-local-repository
					dependency:sources
				
		Maven Standard Directory Layout
		
		Maven Build Lifecycles
			Lifecycle is a predefined group of build steps called phases
			Each phase can be bound to one or more plugin goals
		
			Lifecycles
				validate
				compile
				test
				package
				verify
				install
				deploy
		
		Maven Wrapper
