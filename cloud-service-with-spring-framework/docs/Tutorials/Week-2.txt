Servlets
	In server, HTTP requests are routed to web container which contains servlets
	Servlet --> a java object
		containing the methods for handling the http requests based on request method
		servlet handles request for certain resources
		this is decided the config available in web.xml
		extends the HttpServlet class and override the required methods
	
	Request Routing
		this is defined in web.xml
			create / defining a servlet
				name
				class of the servlet
			routing / mapping the url to the servlet
				name of the servlet
				url-pattern
				
	Securely Handling Client Data & Avoiding Injection Attacks
		Sanitize the inputs recieved from the client
		the data may cantain unwanted data or js or sql injections
		Validate the client data
		
	Building Cloud Services on HTTP
		Spring Dispatcher Servlet
			Before starting to processing the work on input from client request, the following steps had to be done
				Extract inputs from http request
				Validate the inputs
				Construct required java object
			These steps can be overcome using Dispatcher Servlet provided by spring which routes the request to the appropriate controller's method
			HTTPMessageConverter will convert the json to required java object specified as part of Requrest Body
			
			Handling Multipart Data
				@RequestParam("data") MultipartFile object --> as input object to controller's method
				For multiple files use MultipartFile[]
				The multipartFile object has inputStream object to read the data
				Specifying the multipartFile and other attributes like max size
					Create a Bean for MultipartConfigElement
						Create a MultipartConfigElement from MultipartConfigFactory and add the required attributes and return the MultipartConfigElement object
